# How do I approach designing software?
Some new design skills that my work on the project has helped me to craft are creating and modifying 3D shapes, adding texture shaders, and setting up lighting. The design process I followed for my project work was to first take note of all the specific requirements that I needed to fulfill, and then one by one go through them and modify my program to fulfill each one. The tactics from my design approach could be applied in future work in future creative endeavors. When I have a major creative assignment I need to complete in the future, I can once again make it a priority to gather all the necessary requirements and then begin to dive into the assignment by working on it in little bite-sized pieces by fulfilling one requirement at a time. 

# How do I approach developing programs?
Some new development strategies I used while working on my 3D scene were to parse through the instructions to collect requirements that my program needed to fulfill. 
Iteration factored into my development in the form of changes to my code. Every time I made a change to my code, whether it be big or small, I saved my work, and then ran my program. This way, I could see the effects of my changes on the actual render. 
My approach to developing code has evolved through the milestones by learning more and more about how the 3D modeling code base is built and how the different components of it work together to create and render a 3D scene.
At first, I was unsure about using the code base, as I did not understand how it worked or how to modify it without accidentally breaking something.
But after completing numerous assignments with it, and utilizing the help of my professor, I was able to add to the code base and code all of the functions and code lines that were necessary to render my final project, leading to the project's completion. I have also grown much more confident with navigating the OpenGL software itself. 
        
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computational graphics and visualizations give me new knowledge and skills that can be applied in my future educational pathway by giving me the knowledge and skills needed to create and render 3D scenes in OpenGL. 
These are likely generic skills in 3D modeling and rendering that are not just specific to OpenGL, so I could apply them to future projects that might use different 3D rendering software, such as Blender. 
I can now apply the skills of basic 3D shape manipulation, texture shading, and lighting to future projects that involve 3D design. I can also use these basic skills as a launchpad to get into more advanced and complex 3D modeling concepts and skills to create and render more elaborate 3D scenes.  
Listing my skills in OpenGL and providing links to the projects completed in this class could make me a more valuable candidate to employers when applying for jobs in computer science. Employers could see these skills and consider me a good fit for job postings that involve the use of OpenGL software. Essentially, listing these skills can broaden my horizons for which jobs and career paths I can be qualified for.
