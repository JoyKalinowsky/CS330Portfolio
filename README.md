# How do I approach designing software?
Some new design skills that my work on the project has helped me to craft are creating and modifying 3D shapes, adding texture shaders, and setting up lighting.  
The design process I followed for my project work was to first take note of all the specific requirements that I needed to fulfill, and then one by one go through them and modify my program to fulfill each one.  
The tactics from my design approach could be applied in future work in future creative endeavors. When I have a major creative assignment I need to complete in the future, I can once again make it a priority to gather all the necessary requirements and then begin to dive in to the assignment by working on it in little bite-sized pieces by fulfilling one requirement at a time. 

# How do I approach developing programs?
Some new development strategies I used while working on my 3D scene were to parse through the instructions to collect requirements that my program needed to fulfill. 
Iteration factored into my development in the form of changes to my code. Every time I made a change to my code, whether it be big or small, I saved my work, and then ran my program. This way, I could see the effects of my changes on the actual render. 
My approach to developing code has evolved through the milestones by , leading to the project's completion.
I have also grown much more confident with navigating the OpenGL software and understanding the code base and how it works. 
        
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computational graphics and visualizations give me new knowledge and skills that can be applied in my future educational pathway by
Listing my skills in OpenGL and providing links to the projects completed in this class could make me a more valuable candidate to employers when applying for jobs in computer science.
