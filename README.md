# How do I approach designing software?
Some new design skills that my work on the project has helped me to craft are improved debugging abilities,  
The design process I followed for my project work was first read over the instructions, take in fully what the requirements of my assignment are, and then 
The tactics from my design approach could be applied in future work 

# How do I approach developing programs?
Some new development strategies I used while working on my 3D scene were 
Iteration factored into my development in the form of changes to my code. Every time I made a change to my code, whether it be big or small, 
My approach to developing code has evolved through the milestones by , leading to the project's completion.
